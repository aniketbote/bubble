**Project Description:**
**************************
* The fundamental purpose of this project is to give a better platform to NYU students so that they can interact with each other and develop a connection. This app will build a community of students so they can share their experiences with peers.


* Bubble is a resource for NYU students which they can use to resolve common problems they face in their academic life. With this app users can ask their queries, share their experiences, provide their opinions, answer other studentâ€™s queries and much more. This application can be a great guide for students who are joining NYU for the first time, or a fresh breath for already existing students. Given this app only allows people from NYU, it provides a sense of community, security and unity as well. It congregates all these features at one place and creates a data resource for students to refer to.

\
**Motivation:**
****
* The main motivation behind building this application is for new incoming students to take advantage of the experience and knowledge of their seniors, right from the best place to eat near campus to the best courses to take for career advancement. The goal of this project is to create a forever increasing data resource compiled by students to help students. This platform will be a key place to exchange ideas, opinions and knowledge which will be beneficial for all.
