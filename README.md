# Bubble

### Online resource for NYU
------------------------------------------------

* The fundamental purpose of this project is to give a better platform to NYU students so that they can interact with each other and develop a connection. This app will build a community of students so they can share their experiences with peers.


* Bubble is a resource for NYU students which they can use to resolve common problems they face in their academic life. With this app users can ask their queries, share their experiences, provide their opinions, answer other student’s queries and much more. This application can be a great guide for students who are joining NYU for the first time, or a fresh breath for already existing students. Given this app only allows people from NYU, it provides a sense of community, security and unity as well. It congregates all these features at one place and creates a data resource for students to refer to.
